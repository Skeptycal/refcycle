"""
A 'DirectedGraph' is an object representing a simple directed graph.

A directed graph consists of:

  - a collection of vertices
  - a collection of edges
  - a mapping 'heads' from edges to vertices
  - a mapping 'tails' from edges to vertices

This setup allows for self-edges, and multiple edges between a pair of
vertices.  Since we want to use these directed graphs to represent references
between Python objects, both these capabilities are necessary.
