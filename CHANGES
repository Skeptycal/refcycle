Refcycle changelog
==================

What's new in 0.2.0
-------------------

- Add annotations for getset_descriptor referents.

- Reduce memory usage of the AnnotatedGraph object by adding __slots__
  to the AnnotatedEdge and AnnotatedVertex types.


Changes since 0.1.2
-------------------

- Fix missing annotation for f_trace on frames.  This was causing one
  of the tests to fail when run under coverage.


Release 0.1.2
-------------

- Fix frame annotation test that failed on second and subsequent test runs.

- Rewrite README.rst and long description: update with PyPI information;
  remove outdated information; add prerequisites.

- Fix docs so that PDF build succeeds.


Release 0.1.1
-------------

- Fixed missing 'README.rst' in source distribution.


Release 0.1.0
-------------

- Added annotations for frame objects.

- Add 'IDirectedGraph.source_components' method for finding
  the strongly connected components not reachable from other
  components.

- Add annotations for basic types (strings, numbers).

- Fix buggy 'ancestors' and 'descendants' methods that didn't reliably
  explore to the given depth.

- Rename original 'export_json' (converting to a string) to 'to_json';
  'export_json' now exports to a file.

- Added ObjectGraph.export_image function; uses the Graphviz 'dot' command
  (if available) to write an image file.

- Ensure that export_json and to_dot always return Unicode.

- Fix quoting of labels with double quotes in in to_dot.

- Documentation and docstrings greatly improved.

- IDirectedGraph now inherits directly from appropriate abstract base classes
  (Container, Iterable, Sized).
